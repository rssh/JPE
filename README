  JPE -- partial implementation of Java Partial Evaluator.

  It took Java program and values for set of compile-time constansts
 and perform partial evaluation (or we can say - partial specialization 
 against set of constant) of program, than (optionally) perform elimination 
 of dead code and class finalization.


 Example: let we have something like:

    int main(String[] args)
    {
      if (CompileTimeConstants.DEBUG) {
         System.out.println("debug");
      }
      System.out.println("Hello");
    }

  Then we can receive two possible specializations:

    int main(String[] args)
    {
         System.out.println("debug");
      System.out.println("Hello");
    }

   when CompileTimeConstants.DEBUG is true or

    int main(String[] args)
    {
      System.out.println("Hello");
    }

   when one is false.

  Users guid in odf format is situated in docs directory.
